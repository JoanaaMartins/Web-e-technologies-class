    <h3>5 MYTHS ABOUT BOOKING A FLIGHT THAT YOU NEED TO IGNORE</h3>

      Let’s talk about cheap flights. We all know airlines are out to screw us
      over — and no one wants to be the person who gets stuck paying the highest
      fare. That’s why we spend hours upon hours researching articles on
      airfare, trying to game the system like we’re attempting to outsmart a
      used car salesman.<br /><br />
      <a
        href="../ficha3(19out)/Imagens Ficha 03 - HTML/blog_card.png"
        >I’ve written about finding a cheap flight before</a
      >
      — and even
     <img src="../ficha3(19out)/Imagens Ficha 03 - HTML/image_text.png" alt="image_text">
       
        >my process for booking a flight</a>>
      — but today I want to talk about some persistent and inaccurate myths
      about booking a flight that have stuck around through simple inertia and
      lazy journalism. <br /><br />
      There are a lot of articles out there that list “secret hacks” claiming to
      save you thousands. “If you book a flight on a Tuesday during a blood moon
      while standing on one leg, you’ll get the cheapest flight possible!”<br /><br />
      Ok, that’s an exaggeration. But I read so many articles that are
      straight-up inaccurate and outdated that, today, I want to explain which
      “rules” are straight-up lies so you don’t follow them, save hours of time,
      and still end up with a cheap flight!
